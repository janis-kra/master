[Experimentation fluff piece]
[Passive user feedback fluff piece]
Here, I introduce the most important concepts that are needed for understanding this abstract.
I write something about designing and implementing a system for retrieving and analysing passive user feedback.
This includes researching solutions for storing, aggregating and analysing user feedback data.
A prototype using the chosen technologies is then implemented, which involves setting up and configuring various services as well as writing software that glues everything together.
The system is evaluated via a controlled experiment, in order to validate the findings in this thesis.
This will presumably involve either a user test \todo{what is the correct term for 'user test'?} for gathering passive user feedback, or analysing the user actions in an existing data set~\cite{Deka:2017:Rico}.
The gathered data is then aggregated and analysed using the implemented system, and then compared with the results of a questionnaire with usability experts.
